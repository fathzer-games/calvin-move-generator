# calvin-move-generator
A port of [Calvin chess engine](https://github.com/kelseyde/calvin-chess-engine)'s move generator

## WARNING: This project is just a demonstration. It is a discussion base. It will be deleted soon without any notice!

## Some subject to discuss further (maybe)
- Removes Board.print and partly replaces it with board.toString. //TODO
- Removes the Board.from(String) method to cur the dependency to FEN parser?
