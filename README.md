# calvin-move-generator
A port of [Calvin chess engine](https://github.com/kelseyde/calvin-chess-engine)'s move generator.

## WARNING: The official project of extracting the move generator of the [Calvin chess engine](https://github.com/kelseyde/calvin-chess-engine) is [here](https://github.com/kelseyde/calvin-chess).

As the official project is stalled for a while (no PR accepted since end of January 2025), this project is a fallback for delivering bug fixes on the official project.

If the official project is active again, this project will be archived without any notice!
